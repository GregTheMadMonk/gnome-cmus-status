- [x] Add cmus control buttons (or popup caller) to right system tray with track info diplayed
- [x] Add simple key bindings to control playback (_note: setting multimedia keys as bindings may require shell restart to take effect_)
- [x] Show a notification when the song changes
- [ ] Show cover image / extended track info in popup
- [ ] Show cover image in notification
- [ ] More keybindings (?)

## Installation
Clone download the repository and run __make__ or [install from GNOME extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1934/cmus-status/). Remember that you need to have cmus and cmus-remote installed.
