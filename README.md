# gnome-cmus-status
A little GNOME shell extension for displaying and controlling cmus status.

Now extension can:
* Launch cmus in a new terminal window
* Add cmus control buttons (or popup caller) to right system tray with track info diplayed
* Add simple key bindings to control playback. Defaults are:
  * Multimedia play - play/pause/launch cmus
  * Multimedia previous - previous track
  * Multimedia next - next track
_Note: Setting multimedia keys as bindings may require shell restart to take effect_
* Show a notification when the song changes

The extension is really small yet, as I wrote it for myself. This, as well, means, that I have some other features planned that I want to see in the extension such as:
* More key bindings
