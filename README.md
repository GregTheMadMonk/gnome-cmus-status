# gnome-cmus-status
A little GNOME shell extension for displaying and controlling cmus status.

Now extension can:
* Launch cmus in a new terminal window
* Add cmus control buttons (or popup caller) to right system tray with track info diplayed
* Add simple key bindings to control playback. Defaults are:
  * \<alt\> + c - play/pause/launch cmus
  * \<alt\> + x - previous track
  * \<alt\> + v - next track
* Show a notification when the song changes

The extension is really small yet, as I wrote it for myself. This, as well, means, that I have some other features planned that I want to see in the extension such as:
* More key bindings
* Media keys support (is it even possible?)
